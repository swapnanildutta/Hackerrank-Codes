Hackerrank Java Problem : Java ArrayList 
Problem Statement : 
Sometimes it's better to use dynamic size arrays. Java's Arraylist can provide you this feature. Try to solve this problem using Arraylist.
You are given n lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in  position of  line.
Take your input from System.in.
Input Format : 
The first line has an integer . In each of the next n lines there will be an integer d denoting number of integers on that line and then there 
will be d space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer q denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers x and y .
Output Format
In each line, output the number located in  position of  line. If there is no such position, just print "ERROR!"
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 20000
0 <= d <=50000
1 <= q <=1000
1 <= x <=n
Each number will fit in signed integer.
Total number of integers in n lines will not cross 10^5.
How to solve ?
The idea is to create an array of ArrayList and answer the query in O(1) time.
