"""
A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. Given an integer, , rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.

Example


After  rotations, .

Function Description

Complete the rotateLeft function in the editor below.

rotateLeft has the following parameters:

int d: the amount to rotate by
int arr[n]: the array to rotate
Returns

int[n]: the rotated array
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers that denote , the number of integers, and , the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains  space-separated integers that describe .

Constraints

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

To perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
  [1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5,1] -> [3,4,5,1,2] -> [4,5,1,2,3] -> [5,1,2,3,4]
