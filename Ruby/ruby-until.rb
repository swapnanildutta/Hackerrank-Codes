#!Question
#Ruby Control Structures - Until

# This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.

# "A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

# Call the method coder.practice until coder.oh_one? becomes true.

# Use the until control structure.

# until is the logical equivalent of while not.

# Hint

# while not <condition>
#     <code>
# end
# or

# until <condition>
#     <code>
# end
# or the beautiful one-liner

# <code> until <condition>
