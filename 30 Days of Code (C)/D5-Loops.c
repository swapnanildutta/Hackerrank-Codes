/*
Objective
    In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

Task
    Given an integer,   , print its first multiples. Each multiple (where    ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

Input Format
    A single integer,     .

Constraints

Output Format
    Print lines of output; each line (where ) contains the of in the form:
    n x i = result.

Sample Input
    2

Sample Output
    2 x 1 = 2
    2 x 2 = 4
    2 x 3 = 6
    2 x 4 = 8
    2 x 5 = 10
    2 x 6 = 12
    2 x 7 = 14
    2 x 8 = 16
    2 x 9 = 18
    2 x 10 = 20
