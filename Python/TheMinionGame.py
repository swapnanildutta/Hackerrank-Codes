#Type 1
#Kevin and Stuart want to play 'The Minion Game'

#Game Rules

#1) Both players are given the same string, S
#2) Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string .
#3) Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
#4) Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
#5) The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings. 

#Scoring :- A player gets +1 points for each occurance of the substring in the string S

#For Example :- String S = BANANA
#Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
#Here's ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 points.

#Input Format :- A single line of input containing the string S. Also, The string S will contain only uppercase letters [A-Z]

#Constratints :- 0 < len(S) < 10 to the power 6

#Output :- Print one line: the name of the winner and their score separated by a space. If the game is a draw, print Draw.

#Sample Input :- BANANA
#Sample Output :- Stuart 12

Both players are given the same string, S.
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string S.
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

Scoring
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string S.

Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.

Your task is to determine the winner of the game and their score.

Input Format

A single line of input containing the string S.
Note: The string  will contain only uppercase letters: [A - Z].

Constraints
    0 < len(S) < 10^6

Output Format

Print one line: the name of the winner and their score separated by a space.

If the game is a draw, print Draw.

Sample Input
BANANA

Sample Output
Stuart 12

Note :
Vowels are only defined as AEIOU. In this problem,Y is not considered a vowel.
