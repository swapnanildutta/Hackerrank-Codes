Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Formula used:
    Average = (Sum of Distinct Heights) / (Total number of distinct heights)

Input Format:
    The first line contains the integer, N, the total number of plants.
    The second line contains the N space separated heights of the plants.

Constraints:
    0 < N <= 100

Output Format:
    Output the average height value on a single line.

Sample Input:
    10
    161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174

Sample Output:
    169.375

Explanation:
    Here, set ([154, 161, 167, 170, 171, 174, 176, 182]) is the set containing the distinct heights.
    Using the sum() and len() functions, we can compute the average.
        Average = 1355 / 8 = 169.375
