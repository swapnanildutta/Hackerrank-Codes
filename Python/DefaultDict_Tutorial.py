#This is the working code of Default Dict Tutorial problem at Hackerrank in Python 2.  

#The default dict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.
#For example:

#from collections import defaultdict
#d = defaultdict(list)
#d['python'].append("awesome")
#d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
#d['python'].append("language")
#for i in d.items():
#    print i

#This prints :

#('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
#('something-else', ['not relevant'])

#In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. There are n words, which might repeat, in word group . There are m words belonging to word group B. For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not. Print the indices of each occurance of m in group A. If it does not appear , print -1.

#Constrainst :

#1 <= n <= 10000
#1 <= n <= 100
#1 <= length of each word in the input <=100

#Input Format :-

#The first line contains integers, n and m separated by a space.
#The next n lines contains the words belonging to group A.
#The next m lines contains the words belonging to group B.\

#Output formats:
#Output m lines
#The ith line should contain 1-indexed positions of the occurance of the ith word separated by spaces.

#Sample input:

#5 2
#a
#a
#b
#a
#b
#a
#b

#Sample Output :
#1 2 4
#3 5

#Explanation 

#'a' appeared 3 times in positions 1,2 and 4
#'b' appeared 2 times in positions 3 and 5.
#In the sample problem, if 'c' also appeared in word group B, you would print -1

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
list1=[]

n, m = map(int,raw_input().split())

for i in range(0,n):
	d[raw_input()].append(i+1) 
	
	for i in range(0,m):
		list1=list1+[raw_input()]  
		
		for i in list1: 
			if i in d:
				print " ".join( map(str,d[i]) )
				else:
					print -1
