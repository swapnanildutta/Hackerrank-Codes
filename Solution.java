A person is getting ready to leave and needs a pair of matching socks. If there are n colors of socks in the drawer, how many socks need to be removed to be certain of having a matching pair?

Example 
n= 2

There are 2 colors of socks in the drawer. If they remove 2 socks, they may not match. The minimum number to insure success is 3.

Sample Input

2
1
2
Sample Output

2
3
